/**
 * You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. 
 * You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible 
 * to be placed in the given baskets.
 * You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. 
 * The farm has following restrictions:
 * 
 * Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
 * You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
 * You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, 
 * i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * 
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
 * 
 * Time Complexity O(N)
 * Space Complexity O(1)
 * 
 * Similar Problems
 * Longest Substring with at most 2 distinct characters
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with at most two distinct characters.
