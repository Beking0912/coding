The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of ‘K’ elements is Heap. 
This pattern will make use of the Heap to solve multiple problems dealing with ‘K’ elements at a time from a set of given elements.

1. Top 'K' Numbers (easy) minHeap
2. **Kth Smallest Number (easy) 最小K个数**
3. **'K' Closest Points to the Origin (easy) 最接近原点的 K 个点**
4. Connect Ropes (easy)
5. **Top 'K' Frequent Numbers (medium) 前 K 个高频元素**
